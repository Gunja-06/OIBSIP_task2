      <p>
        Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863-4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an
        Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic
        Ramakrishna.He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited
        with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.

        Born into an aristocratic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Kayastha">Bengali Kayastha</a> family
        in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards
        religion and spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramakrishna%27s_samadhi">death of Ramakrishna</a>, Vivekananda extensively
        toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of the
        living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his
        countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_World%27s_Religions">Parliament of Religions</a> in
        Chicago, in which he began his famous speech with the words: Sisters and brothers of
        America... before introducing Hinduism to Americans.He was so impactful at the Parliament that an
        American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the
        Parliament".

          <p>Bartaman Bharat meaning "Present Day India" is an erudite Bengali language essay written by him, which
            was first published in the March 1899 issue of Udbodhan, the only Bengali language magazine of Ramakrishna
            Math and Ramakrishna Mission. The essay was reprinted as a book in 1905 and later compiled into the fourth
            volume of The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda.In this essay his refrain to the readers was
            to honour and treat every Indian as a brother irrespective of whether he was born poor or in lower
            caste.</p>
